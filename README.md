Description
Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique used in classical cryptography. It operates by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

This project implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithms in [programming language] for educational purposes.

Features
Encrypt plaintext messages
Decrypt ciphertext messages
Support for customizable shift (key)
Usage

Encryption:

Provide a plaintext message and the desired shift (key).
Run the encryption algorithm.
Obtain the encrypted ciphertext.

Decryption:

Input the ciphertext along with the correct shift (key) used for encryption.
Run the decryption algorithm.
Retrieve the original plaintext message.
